# CalculatorExpression

This code is written in C# and is a simple code that creates a console-based calculator application. 
Unlike other calculators it can calculate large expressions such as (10 * 5)+100 * 0.5/(4+8-2)

It uses the namespaces System, Microsoft.JScript.Vsa and Microsoft.JScript. 
Microsoft.JScript.Vsa provides classes that enables you to create and manage instances of the Microsoft JScript engine. 
The JScript engine is used to evaluate expressions. Microsoft.JScript contains the classes that provide support for JScript code execution and evaluation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Run the program in the console
4. Enter expressions to be evaluated
5. The result will be displayed in the console

## Features
Ability to evaluate mathematical expressions using JScript.
Continuously prompts to enter expressions until the user stops the application.
